            Hi there! Thank you for checking out my portfolio! My name's Nicole Fell, I'm a student at the Universtiy of California, Davis. I study electrical and computer engineering and am working towards minors in computer science and 
            education. In addition to this, I am extremely passionate about design and look for any way to express my creativity. I have so many interests and subjects I love learning about, and I'm trying to find which avenues I want to puruse and work towards. 
            I have a growing interest in web and application development, primarily in front-end; however, I would like to explore full-stack development more. During my time in school, I realized my interests were growing more in the computer
            science direction and i'd like to explore software engineering more as well. It's really important to me that my work feels impactiful and is helping push positive change, which has led me to become very interested in applying my 
            knowledge in technology to the medical field. Like I mentioned though I have a lot of interests that I was to explore, and i'm also quite interested in education. Teachers hold one of the most important roles in our society and 
            I felt that my education growing up largely influenced my work ethic and what i'm passionate about. I think teaching would be very meaningful work and I would love to explore that path as well. This portfolio is meant to showcase some of
            my technical work, but more so, my work in design. I have many creative hobbies, and want people to be able to get a taste of what makes me tick; at the same getting to combine my love for coding with my love for design in the creation
            of this website is representative of what my dream work would be.
